# Synology Wake On LAN (WOL)

If you need to send a magic packet to your Synology NAS device, this will help accomplish that in addition to a system tray balloon notification when it comes online and how long it took. This script targets ports 7 and 9. The ports array is easily serviceable if additional ports need to be added.

- Replace the IP with that of your Synology NAS

- Replace the MAC address with that of your Synology NAS

- Save, run, have a Coke and a smile
