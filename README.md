# Synology Wake On LAN (WOL)

If you need to send a magic packet to your Synology NAS device to wake it up remotely, this will help accomplish that. In addition, a system tray balloon notification will alert you when the NAS comes online and display a measurement of the time taken to boot. This script targets ports 7 and 9, and the ports array is easily serviceable if additional ports are required.

- Replace the IP with that of your Synology NAS

- Replace the MAC address with that of your Synology NAS

- Save, run, have a Coke and a smile

This script was developed and tested against a Synology DS418
